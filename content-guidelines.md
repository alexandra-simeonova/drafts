## Links

If the link is within the same folder on github, use only the relative path. For all other links, use the absolute path (the one starting with https://...)

## Diagrams 

Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to create diagrams. 

## Terminology/glossary 

* Attributes - the "sub properties" of properties. E.g. the **category** property can have **label**, **icon**, and **collapsible** as attributes. This term derives from the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_%28computing%29) of "attribute" as "a property of a property". 
* Luigi Core - the main application and the settings used to configure it 
* Luigi Client - the micro frontend within Luigi Core and the API used to connect the two 
* Parameters - the parameters that can be added to create a dynamic path.
* Properties - the properties that can be used to configure Luigi in the `basicConfiguration.js` file.
